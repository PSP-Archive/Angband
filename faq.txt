A brief Angband FAQ
===================

1. "I want old school #s as wall tiles, not solid blocks!"
   "There are no walls, and I'm playing on Windows Vista."

   Please see:

2. "How do I get hold of the David Gervais 32x32 tiles?"

   If you're on Windows or using the X11 port, you'll have to download
   them from the below URL and place the files in your lib/xtra directory.

3. "I play in the console on Linux, and the colours are screwed up"

4. "I'm playing in a terminal and the Escape key isn't working as it
   should - I have to press it twice, or just wait a while."

   This is a feature of terminals to allow you to enter keypresses that
   can't be sent directly.  Use the backtick ('`') key instead -- it's
   equivalent in every way to Escape.
