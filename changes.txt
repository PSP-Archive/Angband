Angband 3.0.9
=============

Angband 3.0.9 is a bugfix version of 3.0.8, mostly.  Thanks go to the
many people who reported bugs, helped track them down, and especially
to those who provided patches.

 * Add 'K' command to "mark item kind as squelch".
 * Add squelch_worthless option; does what it says on the tin.
 * Fix use of an uninitialised variable.  (ctate)
 * Restore the "jump into trap and don't autopickup" command.  It
   doesn't "flip pickup" in the same way the old command did.
 * Always cast to (unsigned char) for the islower(), isdigit(), etc
   functions
 * Make graphics for flavoured items work properly in the object browser.
 * Fix command menu display in bigtile menu via something of a hack.
 * Display full monster picture in monster list in bigtile mode.
 * Fix obviously wrong code in main-gcu. (William McBrine)
 * Make disturb_panel work again (this is a 3.0.6 bug).
 * Add _GNU_SOURCE define to silence setresgid() errors. 
 * Give items that provide light descriptions in obj-info.c.
 * Describe the NO_FUEL flag.
 * Fix behaviour of the LITE flag.
 * Collect Banishment effects into one big lump sum.  Death now comes
   quickly.
 * Use better spell and object descriptions.  (Hugo Kornelis)
 * Added <click> or 'g' to some prompts where they are now acceptable
   inputs.
 * Fix acid damage of objects to make it a chance rather than a certainty.
 * Don't count hidden squelchable objects when deciding where to place
   things in monster drops (or whatever).  This should stop drops from
   killing a monster appearing miles away from that monster with
   nothing appearing in between.
 * Make 'Glyph of Warding' 'shove' items out of the way when created on
   a spot.
 * Fix bug in removal of autoinscriptions
 * "!d" stops squelch auto-dropping things, and "!k" marks an object
   not to be squelched.
 * (Windows) Open windows in reverse order so the Term 5 is behind
   Term 4 is behind Term 3 and so on.
 * (GTK) Remember user preferences.
 * Miscellaneous small things reported by Hugo Kornelis.
   (for more info, see <http://dev.rephial.org/trac/ticket/252>)
 * Rewrite description of birth_no_preserve to make it even less
   ambiguous.
 * Allow use of objects from the floor when blind.
 * Reset text indent after squelch help.  This means monster recall no
   longer gets 1-char indents from the side of the screen.
 * (Linux only) Always enter stores when moving onto them.
 * Only mark things as squelchable if we know the 'flavour' through ID
   or whatever.
 * Fixed object detection behaviour w.r.t the hide_squelchable option.
 * Add 'link' to the high score table from knowledge menu.
 * Mark starting equipment as 'everseen' for squelching & object
   knowledge purposes.
 * Add missing entries in the monster knowledge list.
 * Tidied up the knowledge screens, so that recalled text is always at
   the top of the screen, and stop giving artifact spoilers.
 * Report the right number of items in your inventory after a store
   transaction.
 * Stop superfluous '-more-'s in the shops.
 * Avoid possible out-of-bounds array access if you're clev50 when when
   entering the store.
 * Rearrange object knowledge menu, so flavoured items come first.
 * Make EAT_LITE monsters eat light again.
 * Show resist blindness properly in self knowledge displays.
 * Let 'h' work in stores with the roguelike keyset.
 * Removed the x11 "keycode translations" (i.e. rewriting "^_]3244"
   type sequences to "\[PgUp]" type sequences)  for '-' and '=' from
   the pref files to prevent x11's automatic macros from breaking
   those keys.  This was most often manifested when trying to use items
   on the floor.
 * Fixed bug in "Interact with macros" menu where the echoing of macros
   as you typed them would be messed up if any "keycode translations"
   took place.

Autoconf
--------
Please use gmake on BSDs.  It should work OK.

 * Install all files properly.
 * Expand DEFAULT_PATH correctly.
 * Remember to include X11 paths.
 * Chown the angband executable when appropriate.
 * Fix SDL sound support.
 * Fix the "cannot find .depend" error.
