Angband 3.0.9
=============

Angband is a graphical dungeon adventure game that uses textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein, 
in the vein of games like NetHack and Rogue.

Angband is currently maintained by a development "team" headed by Andrew
Sidwell.  Please see the "thanks.txt" file for a full listing of credits.

=== Special instructions for certain platforms ===

Make sure you keep all your savefiles in the proper place, and if you load a
savefile from the wrong place, note that the game may decide to re-save your
savefile in the proper place when you quit.


=== Upgrading from older versions (and/or other platforms) ===

If you have been using an older version of Angband (and/or playing on a
different platform), you can move to the current Angband, bringing your
old savefiles, high score list, and other files with you.

To use an old savefile, simply copy it into the "lib/save" directory, changing
the name of the savefile (if necessary) to satisfy the requirements of the
platform you are using.  On multi-user systems, the savefile should be named
"UUU.NNN", where "UUU" is the userid of the player (on multi-user systems),
and "NNN" is the name of the "character" in the savefile.

Angband uses a platform independant file format for the binary file
used to store the high score list.  This file is named "scores.raw".  To
use an old high score list, simply copy it into the "lib/apex" directory.

If you're interested in what else lies in lib/, then please read
"lib/readme.txt".
